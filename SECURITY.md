## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting or email the maintainer
3. Include: description, steps to reproduce, potential impact, and suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a fix within 14 days.
